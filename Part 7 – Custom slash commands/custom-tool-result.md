## This is my prompt after creating custom tool
# > /plan write a blog on Gemini CLI

### Here is the response
âœ¦ Here is a step-by-step plan for writing a blog on the Gemini CLI:

  1. Understanding the Goal

   * Primary Objective: To introduce the Gemini CLI to a technical audience, primarily software developers, and
     showcase its potential to enhance their productivity and streamline their workflows.
   * Target Audience: Developers, DevOps engineers, and tech enthusiasts who are comfortable with the command
     line and are interested in leveraging AI tools in their development process.
   * Key Takeaway for Readers: Readers should understand what the Gemini CLI is, its core capabilities, how it
     differs from traditional CLIs and other AI assistants, and how they can get started using it. The post
     should inspire them to try it out.

  2. Analysis

   * Core Concept: The Gemini CLI is an AI-powered command-line interface that combines natural language
     understanding with the ability to execute commands and interact with the local file system.
   * Key Differentiators:
       * Context-Awareness: It operates within the user's project directory, giving it access to files and code.
       * Tool Integration: It has a rich set of built-in tools for file manipulation (read_file, write_file,
         replace), code search (search_file_content), and shell command execution (run_shell_command).
       * Extensibility: The presence of .gemini/commands/plan.toml suggests that users can create their own
         custom commands, which is a powerful feature for tailoring the tool to specific workflows.
       * Safety: The model is designed to explain critical commands before execution, which is a crucial
         trust-building feature.
   * Unique Selling Points:
       * Reduces context switching by bringing documentation, web search, and code interaction into the
         terminal.
       * Accelerates common development tasks like refactoring, debugging, and writing boilerplate code.
       * Acts as a "pair programmer" that can reason about code and suggest changes.

  3. Strategy

  This strategy outlines the structure and content of the blog post.

   * Catchy Title: "Gemini CLI: Your AI-Powered Co-pilot in the Command Line" or "Revolutionize Your Workflow
     with the Gemini CLI".

   * Introduction:
       * Start with a relatable developer scenario: juggling multiple windows for coding, searching for
         documentation, and running terminal commands.
       * Introduce the Gemini CLI as a solution that unifies these tasks into a single, intelligent interface.
       * Briefly state what the article will cover: what Gemini CLI is, its key features, and how to get
         started.

   * Section 1: What is the Gemini CLI?
       * Explain the concept of an AI-native command line.
       * Describe it as a conversational agent that understands your goals and has the tools to help you achieve
          them directly in your development environment.
       * Contrast it with traditional CLIs (imperative commands vs. declarative goals) and web-based AI chats
         (local file system access vs. sandboxed environment).

   * Section 2: Core Superpowers: A Tour of Gemini CLI's Features
       * Structure this section around developer workflows, using subheadings for each.
       * "Code Intelligence and Refactoring": Demonstrate a scenario using read_file to understand a function,
         and then replace to refactor it.
       * "Project Navigation and Search": Show how to use glob to find all test files and search_file_content to
          locate a specific API usage.
       * "Automating Tasks with Shell Commands": Provide an example of using run_shell_command to install
         dependencies, run tests, and start a development server.
       * "Bringing the Web to Your Terminal": Explain how google_web_search can be used to find a solution to an
          error message without leaving the CLI.
       * "Building Your Own Tools: Custom Slash Commands": This is a key differentiator. Explain the concept of
         custom commands and how the plan.toml file allows users to create their own powerful, reusable
         workflows.

   * Section 3: Getting Started in 5 Minutes
       * Provide a simple, clear, step-by-step guide to installing the Gemini CLI.
       * Include a "Hello, World!" style example that gives the user an immediate sense of accomplishment, such
         as asking the CLI to create a new file and write some text to it.

   * Section 4: The Future is Conversational: Why This Matters
       * Discuss the broader implications of AI in the development workflow.
       * Talk about the shift from memorizing commands to expressing intent.
       * Emphasize the potential for increased productivity and creativity when developers can offload tedious
         tasks to an AI assistant.

   * Conclusion:
       * Summarize the key benefits: increased efficiency, reduced context switching, and a more natural way to
         interact with your development environment.
       * End with a strong call to action: "Download the Gemini CLI today and experience the future of software
         development."
       * Provide links to the official documentation, community forums, and GitHub repository.

  4. Verification

   * Technical Accuracy: All command examples must be tested and verified to be correct and up-to-date with the
     latest version of the Gemini CLI.
   * Clarity and Flow: The blog post should be read by at least one other person to ensure the narrative is
     clear, engaging, and easy to follow for the target audience.
   * Code Examples: Ensure that the code and command examples are simple enough to be easily understood but
     complex enough to be meaningful.

  5. Challenges

   * Avoiding Hype: While the tone should be enthusiastic, it's important to be realistic about the capabilities
      and limitations of the tool. The focus should be on practical benefits, not just futuristic promises.
   * Technical Depth: The post needs to strike a balance between being accessible to newcomers and providing
     enough technical detail to be valuable to experienced developers.
   * Keeping Content Evergreen: The Gemini CLI is likely to evolve rapidly. The blog post should focus on the
     core concepts and workflows that are less likely to change, rather than specific UI elements or command
     flags that might be updated. Mentioning the version of the CLI being discussed can also help.
